# Whole Genome Pairwise Alignment Pipeline

## Introduction

This pipeline is a comprehensive tool for whole genome pairwise alignment using `lastal`. It is designed to facilitate alignment, chaining, and netting of genomic data. The primary objective is to provide an efficient and user-friendly approach to comparative genomics, specifically for aligning entire genomes.

## Requirements

- **Nextflow**: Workflow management that allows the pipeline to be run across multiple compute infrastructures in a portable manner.
- **R**: The pipeline requires R to be installed, along with the `CNEr` package, which is used for handling genomic alignment data.
- **lastal**: A tool used for the alignment step of the pipeline.
- **kentUtils**: A collection of command-line tools for manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing genomic datasets.

## Installation

To install the pipeline, clone the repository from GitHub:

    git clone https://github.com/da-bar/whole_genome_pairwise_alignment.git

## Usage

To run the pipeline, use the following command:

    nextflow run main.nf -c nextflow.config

### Configuration

Configure the pipeline by editing the `nextflow.config` file. A typical configuration might look like this:

    params {
        reference = '/path/to/reference/reference.fasta'
        query = '/path/to/query/query.fasta'
        output = '/path/to/output_folder'
    }

## Parameters

Details about the parameters used in the pipeline will be provided (TBA).

## Process Description

1. **Aligning with lastal**: Performs whole genome alignments using the `lastal` tool.
2. **Chaining the Alignment**: Chains the alignment data for better genomic alignment interpretation.
3. **Netting the Chains**: Applies a netting process on the chained data to filter and refine alignments.
4. **Export in axt Format**: The final alignments are exported in the `axt` file format for further analysis.

## Output

The pipeline produces several outputs, including:

- Alignment in MAF (Multiple Alignment Format) file.
- Alignment in PSL (Pairwise Sequence Alignment) format.
- Chained alignment files.
- Filtered chains and syntenic nets.
- Final netted alignment in AXT format.

## Example

An example Nextflow config, along with test genomes of _S. cerevisiae_ and _S. eubayanus_, will be included in the GitHub repository.
